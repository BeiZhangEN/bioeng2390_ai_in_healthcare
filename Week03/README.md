## Course Overview
Welcome to BIOENG 2390: AI in Healthcare. 


## Week03: Developing statistical models from EEG data, engineering features from time series data, using the frequency domain, implementing machine learning algorithms using H2o
This week we continued our analysis of EEG signals to detect seizures. We focused on engineering features from time series data, using the frequency domain, and implementing machine learning algorithms using H2o. The project is divided into several scripts and a Jupyter Notebook, each performing specific tasks.
